# Amazon-comments-sentiment-analysis-
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for sentiment analysis of Amazon food reviews. The project uses Python and several popular machine learning libraries, including Scikit-learn and NLTK.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which contains food reviews from Amazon customers. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews, or you can download it from the ressorces provided.

## Getting Started
To use this notebook, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

You will also need to install the following libraries using pip:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
nltk
Once you have installed these dependencies, you can open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to follow along with the sentiment analysis.

## Methodology
The sentiment analysis in this project is performed using a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The notebook walks through the following steps:

Loading and cleaning the dataset
Exploratory data analysis
Preprocessing the text data
Feature extraction using bag-of-words and TF-IDF vectorization
Training and testing machine learning models using Logistic Regression and XGBoost.
Evaluating the performance of the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
## Conclusion
This project provides a practical introduction to sentiment analysis of text data using machine learning. By completing the notebook and analyzing the Amazon food reviews dataset, you will gain a deeper understanding of the natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms involved in sentiment analysis, as well as their potential applications in real-world scenarios.
